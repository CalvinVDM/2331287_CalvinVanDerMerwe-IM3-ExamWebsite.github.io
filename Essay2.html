				We can see that in recent years of technology, a new type of software has risen and has been developing rapidly over time. The technology that I’m referring to is artificial intelligence (AI) and as we have seen this year the advancements of AI have been tremendous and now AI can be used by people in their everyday lives. The improvement of this technology allows many users to generate unique responses and get help from AI to perform problem-solving and provide solutions for any difficulties they might have. It can also be used to generate entertainment and recreate the voices of music artists or even make art based on text prompts.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Although having these good qualities the "Statement on AI Risk" released by the Coalition for AI Safety (CAIS) sheds light on the potential risks associated with AI. As we see the rise of AI, we also see an imposing threat in many regards especially when we think about the inequalities that take place within the digital realm. One of these threats that relate to ownership ad copywriting is how people can use AI to generate the voices of musicians and then generate lyrics as well as release songs that sound eerily similar to the original artist. This undercuts the original artist as well as takes away from their abilities and talents. It also means that the artist and or studio who have trademarked their voice can not get royalties or their dues from AI-generated pieces. This is also used to undercut the credibility of things as now we don’t know if something is someone’s original work or if it is generated using a database. This means that things like online tests in varsity will no longer have meaning as one could simply generate the answers. It also means that we don’t know if people have created the things that they said they have made and so who takes ownership of the products produced from this.
				
                
			</p>

		

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				When looking at all these points we realise that AI is a new way of deepening digital inequalities, and it creates new forms of marginalisation within the digital realm. When relating this to digital artists we can we an issue of them struggling to make a living from their skills as now we can see that there Is a cheaper and more efficient way of producing the art they produce or even making more useful artworks. An example of this could be in doing concept art for Game Design. One could simply use text prompts and play with their words to generate the concept art needed to create games and make new characters and environments. This all relates to the reading by Christoph Luts called “Digital Inequalities in the Age of artificial intelligence and big data”. In this reading, he talks about the 3 digital divides and how AI contributes to them. In the reading, we can also see how the use of AI takes away from people learning ability and desire to perfect and improve skills. As they now have an engine that can do it for them there is no longer a need or desire to learn the necessary skills required to do certain jobs and perform certain functions. This means that we have people that spend a lot of time in a career field but know very little about it as they have not improved themselves and expanded their knowledge on those topics and things of interest.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The next thing we need to realise is that AI also has inherent biases and discrimination because everything it knows is based on the knowledge it receives from its coder. Meaning that AI only knows the things that have already been put into it and it does not learn as it does or else it would be too powerful. This also means that the AI inherits certain biases and discrimination from the knowledge coded into it. So, while AI can be a useful tool it can also misdirect and be heavily misleading with the information that it gives.  This is why people are often encouraged to gather their information and sources so that they know the truth and can accurately ascertain their own opinions and beliefs on certain topics and ideologies. When using AI, a person instead inherits the biases that have been programmed into that AI. So, we see that as we develop further technology becomes more intertwined within our daily functions and in a way, it controls and manipulates us to a massive extent as it is the best tool to use to spread misinformation and demonise ways of thinking. This also applies to social media as that stems from digital inequalities.

				
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Algorithmic Culture and Design Justice is another interesting topic when it comes to the uses of AI due to the impact that AI has on the design and governing of online spaces. When looking at design justice we realise that it is the addressing of the imbalances that occur due to the inequalities of design practices. Design justice is there to make sure that all people and communities may be beneficial and use technology to its fullest potential. This is on the opposing side of AI due to AI’s algorithm thinking and decision-making as AI tried to shape users in the same way that it was shaped. In a way, we can think of AI as propaganda as it makes you think a certain way and influences your decisions and actions. It does this by shaping your user experience and making sure that the information you encounter solidifies and empowers certain ways of thinking and meaning-making. This also works in favour of those with the power of technology as when this technology is used in areas of hiring and services it’s hard to understand the Ais decision making and therefore, we don’t question its actions meaning that there isn’t transparency between the employer and employees and not all information is being given to certain parties. AI results in users being confined to a narrow range of perspectives, limiting their exposure to diverse ideas, and contributing to ideological polarization. This fragmentation of online spaces further deepens social divisions and hampers efforts to foster inclusive and democratic discourse.

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				As we can see the ethical implications of AI being used on the internet are of great importance. Ensuring that AI is developed under ethical circumstances is paramount to our future because if it is not developed ethically the risks, we face will surely stunt the growth and thinking of people in the future not to mention the injustice that will be caused due to the inequalities we face digitally. Ethical concerns arise from the unchecked power of AI and the potential for widespread surveillance, privacy breaches, and data exploitation. As AI is a learning tool it is data-hungry and the questions we feed it will become part of its information systems. In the future, if we are not careful the entity that will know the most about you will be AI, and this is very worrying when we consider how it can be used against us. Our privacy and information will be used against us to manipulate us as now the AI can understand our ways of thinking and how we operate. As AI systems increasingly collect and analyse vast amounts of personal data, there is a need for robust privacy protections and data governance frameworks. Without adequate safeguards, individuals may be subjected to undue surveillance, profiling, and manipulation, further amplifying digital inequalities.

				
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Moreover, the ethics of AI extend to considerations of accountability and responsibility. When AI systems make decisions that impact individuals' lives, it is essential to assign responsibility and establish mechanisms for redress in case of algorithmic bias or error. This requires clear guidelines, standards, and regulations that ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in the design, development, and deployment of AI technologies. We need these safeguards to protect ourselves and others from any further developing Digital inequalities that will occur with the rise of AI as a tool that can be used to take advantage of us in the most unthinkable of ways. We also often have to wonder how developers use our information to their advantage just like how recently there was a court case against the creator of TikTok as people in America believed that TikTok was being used as a Chinese spy app for people from China to gather and use information on people to manipulate and control them. This is a common anomaly as it’s often where the ethics of media and applications are called into question when we see how blatantly our information is used against us to persuade us to buy certain products or services.

				
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				It is quite often where we see the use of WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter as a means of selling us information. Often when talking to my friends or making mentions about certain things and products these products or services will suddenly make an appearance on the ones for you page. This is shown in the name of the main page being called for you. It’s because these apps track and keep a look out for what things you find interesting and like and then constantly bring them up for you in its algorithm to make sure that you stay interested and addicted to using said app and having a dependence on it. When comparing the like of social media to much more advanced software like AI we see how fearsome AI can be as now one isn’t simply liking and looking at pictures on the internet but rather is actively engaging and giving information to a system that will cater all its process and algorithms to cater responses and thinking for you to keep using it and provide it with further information and power over your life. 

				
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				This brings me to my final thought and thinking on how AI should be perceived. I think that AI as a tool is indeed quite useful and even revolutionary but at the same time it is quite dangerous and can bring forth a multitude of ethical concerns and worries as the potential fallout of something goes wrong is quite worrying. I believe that while being a useful and intricate tool AI should never develop from being a tool and should always be monitored and tested so that it can the quality of its information and its development won’t affect people to a great extent. AI is something that can have massive power over people and should only be used by those who are ethical in their practices and those who have a solid moral background to not use this technology nefariously and against the wellbeing of others.
