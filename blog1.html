				I already have a Github from last year so setting up and understanding how to use and interact with the sight. The experience was much smoother then last year when I first started using it as I had many issues especially with uploads and pulling info. I also have the app on my laptop so working from the desktop is seamless.

				"The library of Babel" was a very interesting and intuitive reading that really resonates with my perspective of humongous and threatening the amount of information we as humans have collected. It really shows that information processing is a huge ordeal. The website shows how interesting it is how people are able to organize and digitize information it also puts into perspective the capabilities and power of the internet as it is able to handle and process this information. The digital version of this also allows more access and les monopolizations of information as I believe information is meant to be shared due to the creation of meaning that can be formed by others that view the information and interact with it. This also has negative effect as we see that people have had their attention spans shortened and so they are unable to go for long periods of time eithout stimulus and so I believe that digitized information has its benefits as well as its set backs

				Wits homepage is very lacking lister when compared to ulwazi. The ulwazi page one can see that there has been a lot if thought and effort pit into the seamless usability and utility if ulwazi. There was never a situation in which I struggled or had any difficulty in the use of ulwazi I really appreciate how simple it is and how it's does most of the works for you. As the user it is easy to gage the options available to you and use them as nessassry the quality is immaculate. In comparison wits homepage feels very difficult and overwhelming I never really use it as it's a hassle and has many issues involving the UI and UX.

				For my goals I want to focus on the use of Javascript and what to feel confident and exploration when crafting websites. I do not want to have any confusion and or conflicts in understanding when doing my work this year
