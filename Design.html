It gave of a very fantasy and a vibe that reminded me of "TYPO" so i felt like it fit well. i tried to emulate the website of apple becaus ei liked the aethetic feel and th esections that it used in order to make the website feel professionally done.

									i made this website for those who struggle with anxiety, depression and any other mental illnesses. so with That in mind i tried to made the website give of a very calming sense that made the viers feel calm and welcomed so i used very soft tones like blue orange and pink in order to give of a feel that thier was nothing to worry about. in a sense they cloads and look made me feel like i was floating without any worry in the world so i tried to emulate this with in the website.

		<h1>Thoughts & Reflection</h1>
		
		<p>
			This website was inspired by the feeling that I think I saw many feel this year so far. This year has been tough for the people around me and myself as well so it got me thinking about firstly my mental health and the people around me. Using this thought process I decided to make my website reflect that as a theme and so I tried to emulate the feeling of going to a place to get help and advice and that is why I made the website look like this. The UI was based on an apple website I saw and I thought looked very professional and good so I tried to emulate that and did my best to make it look original by editing it to look more in line with the theme and feel of this website.	</p>
		
		<p>
			I think I have mostly achieved this goal as I added the heading to the top to allow for navigation and I made the website feel like a room of space that one travels to. the art direction makes the website feel unique and I think that the word "Freedom" is communicated to the user through feeling as I think that when one has challenges in their brain freedom is what they seek and so I kept that in mind during the construction of this site.</p>

		<p>
			I tried to keep my UI elements simple and easy but I also wanted to add more interaction, so I added the cards in the blog sections to allow for more moving parts, so the web didnâ€™t feel like a document. I also added the video on the main page so that users get a sense of what this page is for. Lastly, in the portfolio, I tried to make a scrolling window to see all my drawings as I thought it would look best and not take up too much space on the page.
       </p>

		<p>
			Overall, there are still some bugs and things that can be better but so far, I think that it looks good and is a good basis for improvement.	</p>
