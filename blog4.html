                So far, the web development is going well, and I feel like in terms of aesthetics I have grown accustomed to making a website look good. I think I am now able to translate the feelings from the website to the person quite well as now I can use themes and colours very well so that they not only complement one another but also relay emotions. with this particular website, I have realized that making connections between signs and signifiers helped a lot to give off a feeling. What I mean by this is that we get a certain feeling when looking at things as we either have a good connotation or a bad one tied to those things. an example I have is of the clouds which I use on my website the feeling when one is looking at them gives freedom and the ability to do as one pleases and I think that because of this using them gives people the feeling of being free and floating.
            
            </p>

                my wireframes kind of held up against the lecture on IO mostly because e I base them on another website that I have seen and so I think that by using those sites, I was able to translate my UI pretty well. The interface is quite simple but effective and I think that it translates well the emotion of the website as well as the functionality of it as now it is very easy to navigate and use my website and travel as the user sees fit.
               
            </p>

                I think that the UI relates quite well to interactivity as the way we described it talked about the user interacting with a system that interacts with the behind-the-scenes software, and I think that my UI elements do this quite well especially when we look at the blog section of my website where I tried to use more elements that activity need user input.

            </p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
                I like the reading "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" as the way t goes about giving steps and information on UI is easy to understand and it is what I believe UI should be. These principles talk a lot about the functionality of UI and what its supposed to do and this is what I believe is the main point of UI. It helps lay out a basic process of setting up one's user interface before one does any creative and aesthetic adjustments to the Ui to suit either the theme or the message.
            </p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
                Overall, it has been a good week and I think I have made decent progress in web development I can't wait to learn more.
            </p>
